# Issues and Feature Requests

Tracking reported issues or requested features from users

## Creating an issue or feature request

Issues are bugs or technical problems you have with NoteRepo's services. Feature requests are additional features you'd like us (or you want) to implement:

1. Check if your issue / feature has already been created in the `issues` tab and follow the discussion there for updates.
2. Only create issues when you're sure nobody has already (or it will be closed), and be sure to follow the issue templates.
3. We'll try our best to address every open issue and improve NoteRepo for everyone.
