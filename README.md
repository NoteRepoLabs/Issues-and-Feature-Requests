## Creating an issue

Issues are bugs or technical problems you have with NoteRepo's services, to report one:
1. Check if your issue has already been created in the `issues` tab and follow the discussion there for updates.
2. Only create issues when you're sure nobody has (or it will be closed), and be sure to follow the issues template.
3. We'll try our best to address every open issue and improve NoteRepo for everyone.
